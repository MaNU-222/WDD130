    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
        Our objective for this website is to urge all visitors that, they should choose our company over
        any other rafting companies because of our highly trained staffs and their enthusiasm for their jobs. Rafting is 
        very competitive and risk taking, but enjoyable to be on the lake or river with our skilled men and women. People will have 
        the opportunity to participate in a customer review section on the site, which is another reason  for visitors to pick us.
        With the aid of the website, we will speed up and simplify your booking procedure. Even if you have not yet gone rafting, the site 
        will offer you a sneak peek of the experience.
