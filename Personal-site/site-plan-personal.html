      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        My objective for this website is to urge all visitors that, they should choose my company
        over any other computer programing companies, because of my highly trained computational skills
        and the enthusiasm I have for the web developing Jobs. Web developing is very competitive, but enjoyable to achieve a goal.
        People will have the opportunity to participate in a customer review section on the site, which is another reason for visitors to pick us.
        With the aid of the website, we will speed up and simplify your booking procedure. Even if you have not yet seen my work before,
        the site will offer you a sneak peek of the experience.

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        I think there will be 3 three main questions that visitors will want answer.
        Who is the designer and what is his style?, What are some of his previous works or projects?,
        How do i contact him?.
        People will come to this site because they need talented and experience web designer for their small business site, big business site, portfolio or even having their 
        own blog websites. The focus of this website will be mostly designing. The home Page will need to be modern,
        clean, and elegant. I want the logo at the to left of the page, the navigation will have space between at the right side of the Page.
        The main will have a paragraph layout with whatsapp button under it and my name and other details with "about me"
        button under it.
        The footer will be much simple but have the socials at the right corner of the page and site plan, contact, about and projects at the left hand of the page footer
